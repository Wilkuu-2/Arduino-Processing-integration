## How to build + Schematic
The arduino part must be assembled according to the schematic below. After this the code can be uploaded

## Arduino Code
The arduino code can be found in the tab [ ```Robocop.ino``` ](https://github.com/darkroasted/Arduino-Processing-integration/blob/main/robocop.ino) and should be uploaded to the arduino. Then the arduino should be connected to the laptop or computer running the Processing code via a USB cable.

## Processing Structure
The processing code consists of **3 Tabs**:
- [Main Tab](https://github.com/darkroasted/Arduino-Processing-integration/blob/main/RoboCop_ArduinoIntegration/Arduino.pde) (ordinary man tab)
- [Interaction Tab](https://github.com/darkroasted/Arduino-Processing-integration/blob/main/RoboCop_ArduinoIntegration/Interaction.pde) (to be edited by the programmer)
- [Arduino Tab](https://github.com/darkroasted/Arduino-Processing-integration/blob/main/RoboCop_ArduinoIntegration/Arduino.pde)  (not to be edited)
